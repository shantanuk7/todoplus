# Eisenhower Matrix (Urgency Matrix) To do list Web App
A simple To Do List web app with the ability to organize list items by importance and urgency (Eisenhower Matrix)

This type of categorization is also called Urgency matrix. The use case is very simple. You can sort out or categorize your tasks in four different categories: Urgent & Important, Not Urgent but Important, Urgent but not important and lastly, Not Important & Not Urgent. This way, you can priorotize your tasks and can easily decide what to do right now.

## How to decide priority of a task:
The following may come in handy when figuring the urgency and important for a particular task:
- **Do**: Urgent and important tasks. These are the tasks that need to be done immediately and that will have a big impact on your goals.
- **Schedule**: Not urgent but important tasks. These are the tasks that are important, but they can wait. Schedule them for a later time when you have more time.
- **Delegate**: Urgent but not important tasks. These are the tasks that someone else can do for you. Delegate them to free up your time for more important tasks.
- **Delete**: Not urgent and not important tasks. These are the tasks that you don't need to do at all. Delete them from your to-do list to avoid wasting your time.
